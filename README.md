What is Customer Churn? Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame.

Why is Customer Churn Important? A natural process of businesses is that customers will come and go but not all customers are here to stay. For example in the telecom industry, an individual might be there for a few months before churning and trying out a different service. Well, managing and reducing churn rate is important because it costs much more to acquire new customers than i does to retain existing customers.

How to reduce Churn There are many approaches to reduce customer churn but for this project we would attempt to predict which customers are the highest risk of churn by using k-means cluster analysis. Outline:

Look at the different variables to see how it affects churn
Run a K-means cluster analysis
Profile the different Clusters
Then the company will try to create a marketing mix strategy to minimize the Churn rates in the clusters that are the most susespiable to Churn.
